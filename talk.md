Sure, but...

---

.center[## Why is it a bottleneck?]

---


## JS startup pipeline

1. Full fetch + decompress.
2. Transcode to UTF-8.
3. Full parse + full verify + partial AST build.
4. Bytecode compile partial AST.
5. Start interpreter.

‚áí Per-byte cost is high.

---

## Native startup

By contrast:

- No verification.
- Everything is loaded lazily.

‚áí Per-byte cost is ~0.


---


## Better question

Could we get JS startup close to Native startup without changing the semantics of JavaScript?

---

## Requirements

- Not a new programming language.
- Not a subset or a superset of JavaScript.
- Not a bytecode.
- Do not change the semantics of existing programs.
- Do not change the semantics of well-formed programs.
- As transparent as possible.
- Compatible with future versions of JavaScript.

---
name: lexing

# II. The high cost of syntax

---

## The high cost of syntax

Lexing JavaScript is pretty ugly:

- is `for` an identifier or a keyword?
- is `/` an operator, a regexp or a comment?
- is `"use string"` a string or a directive?
- is ` ` a `;`?
- ...

---

## Question 1.1

Could we speed parsing by using a better syntax?

---

## Experiment 1.1

Protocol:

1. Extract (unsafe) binary format from SpiderMonkey AST.
2. Replace text parsing with binary parsing.
3. Benchmark time spent verifying during text parse.
4. Compare speed (Facebook Chat, Firefox Devtools).

---

## Experiment 1.1 - Data & Conclusion

> Could we speed parsing by using a better lexer?

Durations:

- Unsafe Binary Parse vs. Text Parse: *0.3
- Original verification time: ùúÄ

‚áí Experiment conclusive. Let's go Binary AST.

---

## Experiment 1.2

Can we design a binary source format to transport ASTs,
within our requirements?

---

## Strategy

- Specify separately the AST and the binary container.
- Specify AST ‚áí original text-based semantics.
- Specify fine-grained language upgrade mechanism.
- Adopt AST nodes that roughly match text parsing rules.


---

## AST specifications

```java
interface EagerFunctionDeclaration {
  attribute boolean isAsync;
  attribute boolean isGenerator;
  // ...
  attribute BindingIdentifier name;
  attribute FormalParameters params;
  attribute FunctionBody body;
};
```
---

## Validating

![Converting AST to JS text source](img/valid-label.png)

---

## Ecmaify

![Converting AST to JS text source](img/ecmaify.png)

---

Let's encode

```js
function foo(x) {
    ...
}
```

---

## High-level: the AST

```yaml
EagerFunctionDeclaration:
    isAsync: false
    isGenerator: false
    name:
        BindingIdentifier:
            name: "foo"
    params:
        - FormalParameters:
            items:
                - BindingIdentifier:
                    name: "x"
        rest: null
    body: ...
```

---

## Low-level: Binary tokens

```js
[grammar]
  /* 0 */ EagerFunctionDeclaration [ "isAsync" ... ]
  /* 1 */ BindingIdentifier [ "name" ]
  ...
[strings]
  /* 0 */ "foo"
  /* 1 */ "x"
[ast]
  /* EagerFunctionDeclaration */ 0
    /* isAsync: false */ 0
    /* isGenerator: false */ 0
    ...
    /* name: BindingIdentifier */ 1
      /* name: "foo"*/ 0
    ...
```

---

## Mid-level: Per-node versioning

```js
[grammar]
  /* 0 */ EagerFunctionDeclaration [
      "isAsync",
      "isGenerator",
      ...
    ]
  /* 42 */ EagerFunctionDeclaration2021 [
      "typevars",
      "logicalvars",
      ...
    ]
```

---

## Experiment 1.2 - Conclusion

> Can we design a binary source format to transport ASTs, within our requirements?

‚áí Experiment successful: yes, we can.

---

# Status

1. Full fetch + decompress.
2. **Removed** .strike[Transcode to UTF-8.]
3. **Faster** Full parse + full verify + partial AST build.
4. Bytecode compile partial AST.
5. Start interpreter.

# III. The true cost of analyzing

---

## Experiment 2.1

Streaming compilers can amortize the cost of compilation to *O(1 + ùúÄ)*
by folding it into fetching + decompressing.

Can we do it with text JavaScript source?

---

## Interlude - the evils of eval (1)


```js
(function() {
  var a = 10;                // captured
  function foo(code) {       // not captured
    eval(code);
    return a;
  }

  console.log(foo(""));      // "10"
  console.log(foo("var a")); // "undefined"
})();
```

---

## Interlude - the evils of eval (2)

```js
(function() {
  var a = 10;                // captured
  function foo(code) {       // not captured
    my_eval(code);
    return a;
  }

  var my_eval = eval;        // captured
  console.log(foo(""));      // "10"
  console.log(foo("var a")); // "10"!
})();
```

---

## Experiment 2.1 - Result

> Streaming compilers can amortize the cost of compilation to *O(1 + ùúÄ)*
> by folding it into fetching + decompressing.
>
> Can we do it with text JavaScript source?

‚áí No: information needed to compile the first byte may appear anywhere in the file:

- `eval`;
- captured variables.

---

## Experiment 2.2

Could we amend our Binary AST to enable streaming
bytecode compilation, within our requirements?

---

## Strategy

1. Imagine the parser as a mechanism to build proofs
of presence/absence of direct `eval`, etc.

--

2. Request Proof-Carrying Code.

--

Yes, you have heard the words "Proof-Carrying Code" in JavaScript.

---


## AST Specifications (1)

```java
interface EagerFunctionDeclaration {
  attribute boolean isAsync;
  attribute boolean isGenerator;

  // (Informal) proof obligations
  attribute AssertedParameterScope? parameterScope;
  attribute AssertedVarScope? bodyScope;

  attribute BindingIdentifier name;
  attribute FormalParameters params;
  attribute FunctionBody body;
};
```

---

## AST Specifications (2)

```java
interface AssertedParameterScope {
  // Names of function parameters.
  attribute IdentifierName[] parameterNames;

  // Names captured by inner functions.
  attribute IdentifierName[] capturedNames;

  // Presence/absence of syntactic `eval(...)`.
  attribute boolean hasDirectEval;
};
```

---

## Validity semantics

![Validity of eval (abridged)](img/valid-eval.png)

---

## Language specifications

During **compilation**, throw `SyntaxError` if the proof obligation is disproven.

---

## Experiment 2.2 - Status

> Could we amend our Binary AST to enable streaming bytecode compilation, within our requirements?

- ‚áí Intuitively, yes.
- WIP: Build the streaming compiler to confirm.

---

# Status

1. Full fetch + decompress.
2. **Removed** .strike[Transcode to UTF-8.]
3. **Fast O(1 + ùúÄ) (WIP)** Full parse + full verify + partial AST build.
4. Bytecode compile partial AST.
5. Start interpreter.

name: parsing

# IV. The unnecessary cost of parsing

---

## The unnecessary cost of parsing

Recent JS VMs implement a semi-lazy strategy ("Syntax Parsing"):
- parse and verify the entire file;
- only build AST for some functions;
- re-parse and re-verify nested functions as needed.

---

## Question 3.1

Would lazier parsing make things faster?

---

## Experiment 3.1 - Protocol

Would lazier parsing make things faster?

1. Evaluate first-parse time saved by Syntax Parsing.
2. Tweak unsafe binary parser to skip nested/all functions.
3. Evaluate time spent reifying thunks.
4. Compare speed (Facebook Chat, Firefox Devtools).

---

## Experiment 3.1 - Result

First-parse duration effect:

- Syntax Parsing vs. Full Parsing: * 0.8;
- Syntax Binary Parsing vs. Bin Parsing: * 0.8;
- Bin Parsing (skip nested) vs . Bin Parsing: * 0.45;
- Bin Parsing (skip functions) vs. Bin Parsing: * 0.25;
- Time spent reifying thunks: ùúÄ.

--

‚áí Experiment conclusive. Let's go lazy parsing!


---


## Experiment 3.3

Can we alter our binary source format to allow lazy parsing source files,
within our constraints?

---

## Strategy

- Meta-specify laziness at grammar-level, binary container will follow.
- Let the encoder decide what is best left lazy.
- Introduce a mechanism to represent lazy syntax errors.

---

## AST specifications

```webidl
typedef (EagerFunctionDeclaration
      or SkippableFunctionDeclaration)
    FunctionDeclaration;

[Skippable] SkippableFunctionDeclaration {
    attribute contents EagerFunctionDeclaration;
};
```



---

![Altered semantics](img/lazy-parsing.png)

---
name: bonus_delayed_syntax_error

## Language specification

New exception: `DelayedSyntaxError`. May be thrown while **executing** a `[Skippable]` node.

--

- Only affects new programs (opt-in).
- Only affects ill-formed programs.
- The encoder and browser may agree to skip parsing a function.

---

## Low-level: Binary tokens

```js
[grammar]
  /* 0 */ EagerFunctionDeclaration [ "isAsync" ... ]
  /* 1 */ BindingIdentifier [ "name" ]
  /* 2 */ SkippableFunctionDeclaration [ "contents" ] // ‚òú
  ...
[strings]
  /* 0 */ "foo"
  /* 1 */ "x"
[ast]
  /* SkippableFunctionDeclaration */ 2 // ‚òú
    /* implicit byte length */ 128     // ‚òú
    /* contents: EagerFunctionDeclaration */ 0
      /* isAsync: false */ 0
      /* isGenerator: false */ 0
      ...
    ...
```


---

## Experiment 3.3 - Result

> Can we alter our binary source format to allow lazy parsing source files, within our constraints?


‚áí Experiment successful: yes, we can.

---

# Status

1. Full fetch + decompress.
2. **Removed** .strike[Transcode to UTF-8.]
3. **Fast, O(1 + ùúÄ) (WIP)** .strike[Full] Parse + .strike[full] verify + partial AST build.
4. Bytecode compile partial AST.
5. Start interpreter.


---
name: fetching

# V. The avoidable cost of fetching
## (Future work)

---

## Experiment 4.2 (WIP)

Streaming **interpreters** can amortize the cost of **fetching + decompressing + compiling** to *O(1 + ùúÄ)*.

Can we modify our Binary AST to make it possible?

---

## Strategy

- Code we need now should appear before code we don't need yet.

## Reordering native executables

- This transformation exists on native executables.
- Gains witnessed on Firefox executable: *0.9 from I/O reduction. Source: [Mike Hommey](https://glandium.org/blog/?p=1296) (Mozilla).

## Low-level: Binary tokens

```js
...
[grammar]
  /* 0 */ SkippableFunctionDeclaration [ "contents" ]
  ...
[ast]
  /* SkippableFunctionDeclaration */ 0
    /* index in [ast] */ 314     // ‚òú

  /* 42 */ EagerFunctionDeclaration [ "isAsync" ... ]
  /* 43 */ BindingIdentifier [ "name" ]
[ast]
  /* 314 */ /* contents: EagerFunctionDeclaration */ 42
    /* isAsync: false */ 0
    /* isGenerator: false */ 0
    ...
```

---

## Experiment 4.2 - Status

> Streaming **interpreters** can amortize the cost of **fetching + decompressing + compiling** to *O(1 + ùúÄ)*.
>
> Can we modify our Binary AST to make it possible?

- We have not affected the semantics of the language.
- We should be able to parse only the toplevel and then start execution.

‚áí Too early to conclude, but encouraging.

---
